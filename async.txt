- channels

(chan & [buf-or-n xfrm ex-handler]) - create a channel
(to-chan coll)                      - create a channel from a collection
(promise-chan & [xform ex-handler]) - create a channel taking only one value
(thread-call f)                     - create a channel returning the return of 'f when complete
(timeout msec)                      - create a channel that will close in 'msec

(close! ch)                         - close channel 'ch

- buffers

(buffer n)                - creates a blocking buffer of size 'n
(dropping-buffer n)       - creates an unblocking buffer of size 'n which dropps off the back
(sliding-buffer n)        - creates an unblocking buffer of size 'n which dropps off the front
(unblocking-buffer? buff) - predicate returns true for unblocking buffer types

- channel to channel

(take n ch & [buf-or-n])               - creates a channel that takes 'n items from 'ch
(into coll ch)                         - creates a channel returning contents of 'ch put into 'coll (single item)
(split p ch & [t-buf-or-n f-buf-or-n]) - creates tuple of two channels with 'ch contents split by 'p predicate true/false results respectively
(merge chs & [buf-or-n])               - creates channel merging contents of 'chs channels
(map f chs & [buf-or-n])               - creates channel mapping 'f across 'chs channels
